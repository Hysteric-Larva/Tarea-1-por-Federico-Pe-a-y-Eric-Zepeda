    "\n",
    "El análisis de emociones o sentimientos se refiere al proceso de extraer información acerca de la actitud que una persona (o grupo de ellas) manifiesta, en un determinado medio o formato digital, con respecto a un tópico o contexto de comunicación. Uno de los casos más estudiados corresponde a determinar la polaridad de un trozo de texto, es decir, clasificar una determinada evaluación escrita (review ), en que una persona manifiesta una opinión, como positiva, negativa o neutral. Esto también ha sido extendido a otros medios, como lo es analizar la polaridad de textos en redes sociales.\n",
